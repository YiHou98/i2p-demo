### 8. What kinds of analysis would it _not_ support?

__1. Deep study of user experiences. It is impossible to study consumers’ sentiments and find out how users evaluate their experience and what they really care about.(care about )_
_2. Relation between hosts and guests._
We cannot study how hosts and guests judge each other by their gender, race and other characters, which is the digital discrimination(The sharing economy and digital discrimination: The case of Airbnb).
_3. Preferences of different types of consumers._
_4. Analysis about whether Airbnb is a kind of sharing economy and how it affect the local communities._
It is not possible to determine whether the listings have long been available for short-term holiday renting or just conventional bed and breakfast accomodations. Also we don't know who is the landlord of each listing.

### 9. Which of the uses presented in Q.7 and Q.8 are _ethical_?、
Working with geocodes has the potential to expose ethical aspects of doing geographical research.
Although neighbourhood names are cleansed and compiled by comparing the listing's geographic coordinates with a city's definition of neighbourhoods, \
Individuals wish to assure their locational privacy.
_When we use the data from Airbnb or other datasets, although Inside Airbnb uses the public information complied from the Airbnb website, the ethical issues occur inevitably since both the hosts and guests are not well informed about the use of their data._

_Thus, I will firstly list what data used in above-mentioned studies are sensitive and then justify the ethics of these analysis._

_1. Text messages_

_When we want to deeply explore the attributes of the hosts and consumers, we need to do text analysis for their self-description or reviews. However, people who sent these text messages did not consent to our particular use(crisis data). So this is not ethical.

_2. Photos_

_We hope to analysis whether the picture of a host can contribute to the trustworthiness with guests, however, this is the privacy of the host even if the picture is published publicly. _

_3. Other personal information_

_From the pictures of hosts, we can collect data about their gender and race. However, these are all privacy information of people, and it is not ethical to use them._

_4. Geodata_

_We need to use the location information of flat to do spatial analysis.  We do use the location data but we don’t use the specific name of each flat since the neighbourhood names are cleansed and compiled by comparing the listing's geographic coordinates. Also, the studies don’t focus on the location of specific flat, but the special pattern of all Airbnb flats in the area. So I think these studies are ethical._

_Finally, I think the studies involves the picture, gender, race and texts of people are not ethical enough. Analysis based on price not exploring the privacy of hosts,  analysis based on location of flats, and analysis about the impact of Airbnb on housing markets are ethnical.
